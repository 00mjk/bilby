Defining priors
---------------

Priors refer to the prior probability distributions for each model parameter.
Typically, these are passed into :ref:`run_sampler <run_sampler>` as a regular
`python dictionary
<https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries>`_.

The keys of the priors objects should reference the model parameters (in
particular, the :code:`parameters` attribute of the :ref:`likelihood`. Each key
can be either

- fixed number, in which case the value is held fixed at this value. In effect,
  this is a Delta-function prior,
- or a :code:`tupak.prior.Prior` instance.

If the later, it will be sampled during the parameter estimation. Here is a
simple example that sets a uniform prior for :code:`a`, and a fixed value for
:code:`b`::

   priors = {}
   priors['a'] = tupak.prior.Uniform(minimum=0, maximum=10, name='a', latex_label='a')
   priors['b'] = 5

Notice, that the :code:`latex_label` is optional, but if given will be used
when generating plots.

Default priors
--------------

If any model parameter required by the :ref:`likelihood` are not defined in the
`priors` dictionary passed to :ref:`run_sampler <run_sampler>` then the code
will try to use a default prior. By default, these are setup for a binary black
hole and defined in a file like this

.. literalinclude:: /../tupak/core/prior_files/binary_black_holes.prior

You can define your own default prior and pass a string pointing to that file
to :ref:`run_sampler <run_sampler>`.

Complete list of available prior classes
----------------------------------------

We have provided a number of standard priors. You can define your own by
subclassing the :code:`tupak.prior.Prior` class. Here is the complete list of
those implemented:
